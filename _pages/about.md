I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computational Applied Mathematics and Operations Research](https://www.caam.rice.edu) (CMOR) at Rice University in Houston, TX. 
My PhD research is advised by Prof. [Matthias Heinkenschloss](https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~heinken/) and focuses on the analysis and implementation of numerical methods for differential equations and optimal control.
